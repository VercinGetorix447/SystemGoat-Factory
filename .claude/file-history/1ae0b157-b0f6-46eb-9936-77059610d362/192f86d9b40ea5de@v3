## RULE: Task Prioritization Format

ALL tasks must include these columns:

| Column | Required | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| ID | Yes | Task number |
| Task | Yes | Clear description |
| Pri | Yes | Priority 1-100 (higher = more important) |
| Time | Yes | Estimated time to complete |
| ROI | Yes | Return on investment 1-100 |
| Ease | Yes | Ease of completion 1-10 (10 = easiest) |
| Status | Yes | Not started / In Progress % / Done / Blocked |
| Tokens | Optional | Estimated Claude tokens |
| Blocked By | Optional | Dependency task IDs |

**Daily Priority Table Format:**
```
| # | Task | Time | ROI | Ease | Status | Blocked By |
```

**Scoring Rule:** Priority Score = (ROI × 0.4) + (Ease × 0.3) + (1/Time × 0.3)
