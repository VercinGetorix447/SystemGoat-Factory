# CLAUDE SESSION STARTUP - PASTE THIS AT START OF EVERY SESSION

## STEP 1: IMMEDIATELY DO ONE OF THESE
**Option A:** Type `/resume` or press `Ctrl+R` to load previous session
**Option B:** If session lost, tell Claude: "Read /mnt/c/Users/password/Documents/.claude/STARTUP.md"

---

## STEP 2: Claude reads these files and reports:

1. `/mnt/c/Users/password/Documents/.claude/databases/memory.jsonl` - persistent memory
2. `/mnt/c/Users/password/Documents/.claude/Backups/memory-backup-2026-02-01.md` - today's backup (update date as needed)
3. `/mnt/c/Users/password/Documents/.claude/Backups/task-import-2026-01-31.md` - master task list
4. `~/.claude/projects/-home-echo/sessions-index.json` - list all sessions
5. Read the MOST RECENT session .jsonl file (largest/newest) from `~/.claude/projects/-home-echo/`

After reading, provide:
- What we were working on
- Pending tasks (use RULE format below)
- Any blockers or issues
- Docker container status
- Next steps

## RULE: Task Prioritization Format

ALL tasks must include these columns:

| Column | Required | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| ID | Yes | Task number |
| Task | Yes | Clear description |
| Time | Yes | Estimated time to complete |
| Tokens | Yes | Estimated Claude tokens needed |
| Success % | Yes | Probability of successful completion |
| ROI | Yes | Return on investment 1-100 |
| Ease | Yes | Ease of completion 1-10 (10 = easiest) |
| Delegate | Yes | Subagent score 1-10 (see formula below) |
| Status | Yes | Not started / In Progress % / Done / Blocked |
| Blocked By | Optional | Dependency task IDs |

**Daily Priority Table Format:**
```
| # | Task | Time | Tokens | Success% | ROI | Ease | Delegate | Status |
```

**Delegate Score Formula (1-10):**
- **High (7-10) = Delegate to subagent** - Complex, time-consuming, low context dependency
- **Low (1-3) = Do directly** - Quick, simple, needs conversation context
- Formula: Delegate = (Complexity × 0.4) + (Time × 0.3) + (Context-Independence × 0.3)
  - Complexity: 1=simple, 10=complex
  - Time: 1=<5min, 5=30min, 10=>2hrs
  - Context-Independence: 1=needs chat history, 10=standalone task

**Subagent Assignment Guide:**
| Delegate Score | Action | Example Agents |
|----------------|--------|----------------|
| 8-10 | Fully delegate | researcher, devops-engineer, test-runner |
| 5-7 | Delegate with supervision | debugger, refactorer, doc-writer |
| 1-4 | Do directly | Quick fixes, user questions, context-heavy |

**Priority Scoring Rule:**
Priority = (ROI × 0.25) + (Ease × 0.2) + (Success% × 0.25) + (1/Time × 0.15) + (1/Tokens × 0.15)

## CLOUD BACKUP STATUS (Check these if local lost)

| Service | Status | URL/Action |
|---------|--------|------------|
| GitHub | ❌ NEEDS LOGIN | Run: `gh auth login` then check `github.com/VercinGetorix447/SystemGoat-Factory` |
| Supabase | ❌ NOT SET UP | Need to configure |
| Google Drive | ⚠️ PARTIAL | OAuth in `~/.claude/mcp/gdrive/` - sync not automated |
| PocketBase | ✅ LOCAL | `http://localhost:8090` |
| NocoDB | ✅ LOCAL | `http://localhost:8080` |

**Local Backup Paths:**
- Windows: `/mnt/c/Users/password/Documents/.claude/Backups/`
- Linux: `~/.claude/projects/-home-echo/`
- Memory: `/mnt/c/Users/password/Documents/.claude/databases/memory.jsonl`

---

## PRIORITY TASK: Set up cloud backup!
1. `gh auth login` - restore GitHub
2. Push backups to GitHub daily
3. Configure Supabase or S3 for redundancy

DO NOT ask questions. Just read and report.
