# CLAUDE SESSION STARTUP - PASTE THIS AT START OF EVERY SESSION

Read these files NOW and give me a status update:

1. `/mnt/c/Users/password/Documents/.claude/databases/memory.jsonl` - persistent memory
2. `/mnt/c/Users/password/Documents/.claude/Backups/memory-backup-2026-02-01.md` - today's backup (update date as needed)
3. `~/.claude/projects/-home-echo/sessions-index.json` - list all sessions
4. Read the MOST RECENT session .jsonl file (largest/newest) from `~/.claude/projects/-home-echo/`

After reading, provide:
- What we were working on
- Pending tasks
- Any blockers or issues
- Docker container status
- Next steps

DO NOT ask questions. Just read and report.
