| Medium | sonnet | Most development tasks, analysis, writing |
| High | opus | Architecture decisions, complex reasoning |

## Usage Patterns

### Start of Session
```
Use the project-manager agent to review status and plan today's work
```

### During Development
```
Use the code-reviewer agent to review my changes
Use the test-runner agent to run the test suite
```

### Context Maintenance (every 15-20 interactions)
```
Use the context-keeper agent to refresh session state
```

### End of Session
```
Use the project-manager agent to generate today's daily report
```

### When Unsure
```
Use the agent-router to determine the best agent for [task description]
```

## Adding New Agents

1. Create a new `.md` file in `.claude/agents/`
2. Include required frontmatter: `name`, `description`
3. Define appropriate `tools` and `model`
4. Write clear system prompt with structured output
5. Update this registry
