# Claude Code Session Notes

> **IMPORTANT**: This file tracks work progress. Claude should update this every ~5 minutes or after major milestones.

---

## Current Session: 2026-01-29 (Session 2)

### Status: Active
**Started**: ~4:20 PM EST

### Context Recovered from Previous Session
- Set up SQLite-based persistent memory system
- Created `data/workspace.db` with tables: conversations, entities, insights, user_preferences
- Created `data/init-db.mjs` and `data/query-db.mjs` for database operations
- Key decision: Use SQLite MCP for conversation memory

### This Session Goals
- [ ] Verify semgrep installation (NOT INSTALLED)
- [ ] Set up "ref.tools" API (need clarification on what this is)
- [ ] Configure session auto-save system

### Work Completed This Session
1. Discovered semgrep is NOT installed
2. Recovered previous session data from workspace.db
3. Created this SESSION-NOTES.md file for progress tracking
4. Created CLAUDE.md with mandatory session-start instructions
5. Initialized git repo, first commit made
6. Updated CLAUDE.md: "START OF EVERY SESSION: Review SESSION-NOTES + DB"
7. **INSTALLED ref.tools MCP** - API key configured

### Pending/Blocked
- **semgrep**: Still needs to be installed (`pip install semgrep` or `brew install semgrep`)

### Next Session TODO
- Verify ref.tools MCP is working (restart Claude Code first)
- Install semgrep if needed
- Continue with persistent memory MCP setup

### Key Decisions Made
- (none yet this session)

---

## Previous Session: 2026-01-29 (Session 1)

### Summary
Initial setup session. Diagnosed Claude Code installation (NPM v2.1.23, working fine). Set up SQLite-based persistent memory system for cross-conversation context.

### Topics
installation, mcp, memory, sqlite, persistence

### Key Decisions
- Use SQLite MCP for conversation memory instead of ephemeral memory MCP

### Files Created/Modified
- `data/init-db.mjs` - Database initialization script
- `data/query-db.mjs` - Database query utility
- `data/workspace.db` - SQLite database for memory
- `data/package.json` - Dependencies (sql.js)

## Quick Reference

### How to Update This File
Claude should update this file:
1. Every ~5 minutes during active work
2. After completing any significant task
3. Before ending a session
4. When making key decisions

### Database Commands
```bash
cd /mnt/c/Users/Password/Documents/ClaudeCodeProjects/data
node query-db.mjs tables                    # List tables
node query-db.mjs query "SELECT * FROM conversations"
node query-db.mjs run "INSERT INTO ..."     # Modify data
```

### To Restore Context in New Session
1. Read this file first: `SESSION-NOTES.md`
2. Check database: `node data/query-db.mjs query "SELECT * FROM conversations ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 1"`
