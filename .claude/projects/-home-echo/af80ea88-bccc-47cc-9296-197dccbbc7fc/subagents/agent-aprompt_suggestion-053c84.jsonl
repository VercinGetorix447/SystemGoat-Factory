The user's original request mentioned they want to focus 80%+ on completing tasks and making the system competitive\n\nFrom the earlier conversation, the user mentioned:\n- NocoDB kanban board needs to be done first (this was in the memory)\n- Weekly calendar task for reviewing prompts/workflows\n- They were going to paste a prompt but we got sidetracked with GitHub setup\n\nLooking at their pattern - they've been action-oriented, quickly moving through tasks.\n\nThe most likely next step based on their previous context would be:\n- Setting up NocoDB kanban (was mentioned as \"NEXT\" and dependency)\n- Or creating the other repos since we just did GitHub work\n\nGiven they just finished GitHub setup and I listed priorities, they'd likely pick one. Based on the flow and that NocoDB was flagged as \"must be done first\", they'd probably want to continue with infrastructure.\n\nActually, looking more carefully - they mentioned wanting to paste a prompt earlier but we got sidetracked. They might want to get back to that.\n\nBut most naturally after completing GitHub and seeing a priority list, they'd pick from the list or continue momentum. \"set up NocoDB kanban\" or \"create the other repos\" seem most likely.\n\nGiven they just did repo work, continuing with repos makes sense for momentum.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":10,"cache_creation_input_tokens":532,"cache_read_input_tokens":87168,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":532},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXg73ZE15QYvBxC7BaVyV","type":"assistant","uuid":"02e4350c-a307-42a2-842b-08c4614f679a","timestamp":"2026-01-31T20:42:30.229Z"}
