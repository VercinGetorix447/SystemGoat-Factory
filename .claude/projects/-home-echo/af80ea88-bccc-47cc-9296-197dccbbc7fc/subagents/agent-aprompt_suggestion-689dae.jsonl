The user asked to deploy Metabase and have research/app agents help with NocoDB + Metabase + Planka integration for an \"Airtable + Monday.com\" CRM system\n2. I deployed Metabase and launched both research agents in background\n3. Agent progress notification came in (agent still running)\n4. I gave a status update and offered options: check Metabase, continue DocuSeal, or Cal.com, or wait for research\n\nThe user's primary interest was the integration research for the CRM system. They're likely waiting for the research results rather than moving on to other tasks. Given their focus on this specific goal (Airtable + Monday.com style CRM), they'd probably want to wait for the research to complete.\n\nLooking at their style - they're direct and brief. They'd probably say something like:\n- \"wait for research\"\n- \"let's wait\"\n- \"wait\"\n\nOr they might want to check on Metabase while waiting since it was just deployed.\n\nGiven the context of wanting the research agents to help with integration, I think they'd want to wait for results.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":10,"cache_creation_input_tokens":640,"cache_read_input_tokens":146002,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":640},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXgQgsiVreZw4Wur9sczi","type":"assistant","uuid":"177c1e0d-2180-44b7-80d4-5e9598a5c50c","timestamp":"2026-02-01T00:33:42.453Z"}
