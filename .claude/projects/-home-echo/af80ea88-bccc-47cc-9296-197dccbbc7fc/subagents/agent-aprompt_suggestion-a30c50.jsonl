Given the context, they just generated a token and should paste it. But since this is a SUGGESTION MODE prompt, I should predict what they would naturally type.\n\nLooking at the conversation:\n- They're generating a Personal Access Token\n- They just confirmed the settings (repo all, workflow)\n- Claude said \"Click Generate token and paste it here\"\n\nThe most natural next action is they'll paste their token (starts with ghp_...). But I can't predict the actual token. They might just paste it directly, or say something like \"here's the token\" and paste it.\n\nActually, looking more carefully - this is a system prompt asking ME to suggest what the user might type. The user just confirmed token settings. They'll likely paste the token directly or say something short before pasting.\n\nMost natural: they'd just paste the token directly, or say \"here it is\" or similar.\n\nGiven the instruction to stay silent if next step isn't obvious from what user said, and the next step IS obvious (paste the token), I should suggest something like their token format or a simple \"here\" type message.\n\nBut actually - they'll literally just paste a token string. That's not really a suggestion I should make since it's a credential.\n\nI think the most natural thing is silence here since they'll just paste a token, OR if I suggest something, it would be something like \"ghp_...\" but that's weird.\n\nLet me reconsider - the user might say something like \"here it is:\" before pasting, or just paste directly. Since they're in the middle of a credential handoff, staying silent might be best, OR suggesting a placeholder acknowledgment.\n\nActually, the most likely is they just paste the token. I shouldn't suggest the token itself obviously. Maybe silence is best here since the next step (pasting a credential) is obvious but not something I should suggest the content of.\n\nI'll stay silent / provide no suggestion.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":10,"cache_creation_input_tokens":450,"cache_read_input_tokens":85232,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":450},"output_tokens":3,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXg66MosYPJF426btfcxJ","type":"assistant","uuid":"8001ecf5-4713-4b90-af8a-49b6c1a01c91","timestamp":"2026-01-31T20:29:57.443Z"}
