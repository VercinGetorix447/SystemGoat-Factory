Let me outline a robust architecture to solve the memory persistence problem.\n\n## Proposed Architecture\n\n### 1. **Automated Backup System (Every 5 min)**\n- **Cron job or systemd timer** on WSL2 that:\n  - Exports MCP memory graph to the daily `.md` file\n  - Timestamps each backup\n  - Optionally keeps versioned snapshots\n\n### 2. **Session Continuity Protocol**\n- **Session Start Hook**: Auto-read backup file to restore context\n- **During Session**: Checkpoint saves at defined intervals\n- **Session End Hook**: Final summary + backup\n\n### 3. **Notification System**\nOptions:\n- Desktop notifications via `notify-send`\n- Email via Gmail MCP\n- Log file with status dashboard\n\n### 4. **Task Tracking Subagent**\nA dedicated agent that:\n- Records all tasks with status (pending/in-progress/completed)\n- Generates interval summaries (30 min)\n- Updates SQLite database (workspace.db)\n- Future: syncs with CRM\n\n### 5. **Database Schema**\n```\nsessions, tasks, memory_snapshots, daily_reports\n```\n\n---\n\nThis is a significant system to build. I'd recommend we tackle it in phases:\n\n1. **Phase 1**: Backup automation script + cron job\n2. **Phase 2**: Task tracking subagent + database schema\n3. **Phase 3**: Notification system\n4. **Phase 4**: CRM integration\n\nWant me to enter plan mode to design the full implementation, or should we start with Phase 1 (the backup automation) right now?"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":10,"cache_creation_input_tokens":132,"cache_read_input_tokens":23920,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":132},"output_tokens":3,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXeZ7izW9Lj82DvEnVe63","type":"assistant","uuid":"7f531090-3ecc-4f53-b567-1b0793e92849","timestamp":"2026-01-31T01:03:11.905Z"}
