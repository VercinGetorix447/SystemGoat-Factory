The user would naturally describe what's on their screen - likely something about the deployment page, domain settings, or what options they see.\n\nGiven the context (they just saved the docker compose and Claude asked about domains), the user would likely respond with what they're seeing - maybe about domain fields or deployment options.\n\nHowever, this is uncertain since it depends on what the Coolify UI actually shows them. The user has been giving short factual responses like \"yes\", \"ok\", \"better\", \"ready for code\", etc.\n\nThe user would likely describe what they see or ask where to find the domain setting. But I shouldn't suggest a question. They might say something like:\n\n\"I see deploy button\" or \"where is domains\" or describe what they see.\n\nActually, given the pattern, they might just type \"deployed\" or describe what happened, or ask where to find the domain setting.\n\nI think the most natural next step would be them looking for the domains section or clicking deploy.
