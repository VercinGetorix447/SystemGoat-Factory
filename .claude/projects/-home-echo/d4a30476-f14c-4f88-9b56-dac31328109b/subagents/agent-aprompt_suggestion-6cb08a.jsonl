I asked for SSH credentials (username and password/key) to begin the setup. The user just provided the IPv6 address. The natural next step is for them to provide the SSH credentials.\n\nLooking at their style - they're giving short, direct pieces of information. They'd likely provide the SSH username next, or the password/key.\n\nMost likely they'd type something like:\n- \"root\" (the username)\n- Their password\n- Or the SSH key path\n\nGiven they're on WSL and we've been working with paths like /mnt/c/Users/password/Documents/, they might give a key path or just the credentials directly.\n\nThe most natural continuation would be providing the SSH login info. Since I specifically asked for \"Username (probably root?)\" and \"Password or SSH key path\", they'd likely respond with that.\n\nA simple suggestion might be:\n- \"root and password is...\"\n- Or just \"root\" followed by the password\n\nActually, looking at the conversation flow, they might just provide the credentials directly.
