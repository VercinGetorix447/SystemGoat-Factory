They probably would wait and see if Coolify's domain redirect works now, so they'd either confirm it worked, or they may ask to try testing the URL again.\n\nBased on the flow of the conversation, after clicking refresh, they would most likely indicate something like \"done\" or \"ok\" to confirm they clicked it, or they'd report on whether it worked.\n\nLooking at the user's message style, they use short phrases like \"saved\", \"deleted\", \"logged in to coolify\", \"ok - dashboard or 'deploy 1st resource?'\", etc.\n\nMost likely they clicked refresh and will say something like \"done\" or \"ok\" or report what happened. But I should stay silent because we're waiting to see the result of their action - they need to assess what happens after clicking refresh.\n\nActually, after clicking refresh, they might want me to check if the domain works now, so they could say something like \"check it\" or \"try the domain\" or \"ok done\".\n\nGiven their typical short responses, I'd predict something like \"done\" or \"ok\" or they might ask me to verify.\n\nI'll suggest \"done\" or \"check the domain now\" - but \"done\" matches their style better.","signature":"EuIKCkYICxgCKkBG98vtX0o9j2AK93xuKpOdoBkvVCAq+k6n8tSfnYyqXemI//cm4QoheHAJJtRUq395KeSCyzMh0jnvTVhbsv2aEgxmfo83OaoUfsIyN3YaDIttixBwNPty8IM4VCIwL0SCceMuPWpcweYj5ivZqZcw25zpECbnRhBEvqoM0V7M/yV8b0keOu3gK1WsOAziKskJMnl0AQup0O5HSeaYKIwciqnp5JkSgfAPW5BXCE2H+SVKNT8QMZYGqExzkiqYrmth7tXXbC4yGZhBBrs8waZAabTdPBOPgbMwFFcBSWo+uwp0YHFpFWIW8YrEuZbn518mSli4FijWKcfmGp8pP0wl9gITgNFUANOlGfekCDALvjhII3KCM5+DwA4+Oh2dzjQEwr2kExELH+Ryx/DpEzUt9TvYUZu6qjNl/TvMKJHRo796EYSZZZOHYYZkyXw4pEb8BXC9HLwBdQIQcCBknexhB8DMCA+9CFq400cwV9vCUPfFTR6hTUIchFSpXUEl2LzCrnfDCTzh9LUH/OIxb+ZFFR1nELQOMM/CFi1WvZMjSCizAPso+023Er0NFSt2DIuuamsKWKZH6UNiUDkXHckzYBG12pMn2lT+rC0HiFQklXEGIhC8jxPaGcRLFsnse5tNjLvDYJQFMa14CzSdBi/zOPTN0q/pMujxDhQmMrf5s7YPWHZl4m6apkEuUhZcWad5j1P3V6WMSu8KOickA1Vc7ruyg/p2k4u71aWPcTlteZi603XYkKSKW4ewloE5nL4e9EbfLi59DDx82DhKqW3iqaTuDGJvjh1ISu3gpG7wRl/TunC6fA2rLFv8XDx2r91b9loIHH+nsNUceLnOidUJJs3ZAkc1Laxkr3VPYtrh9Nm3IInhegb3N5OO9+aDsGEybH6dSnfAdFT8ewmLFiP/YmrsXOZxiZL0x1L7LjRcN+6cuqoNA3ym9mvH3HKMjt6BneJS4SWE6PbwyXHqAzZBMRF0ay7ZKcphDlplGeqWBnFIsRwLZhqOy6i37y0XMRvaMsVMv22h6caFeACMaOfBqz+DSruSGqwDadagu9gB5B0ryDgYBDB5rbiehmge7L2VBnqrhPlAotGKZ4Qu4/PyEzTE5KgaIL8lw112xla93RloyIrU6afMH+o4tMsgrPkRNZX2ZIwa+p+aqEL/+YovuXF0YOaMo9E48vLNyyywXHgCaNjkazJB0nFby5YcS/6V92sd/xPohtISUgJQMDlofIxOvlwc+hOe4Ny92ml9H1eXUbW8c1bbsF1zjBHqPlNMov5l9PMnLQ/RwarW53wWGnVWnxyg74hwxzIZT8jDiQVk3++9HDKiKzHcuOPGW6FBsBxq5TYV/FtJqCiMLPQ3BLXR7TZY8udLWvqfUBF7Rv/iAsTHnLPghydPPJh3qr2c7D8RtdvbvwduRS//F7M71eYDRf7JSuzsGZgIt2H5+Xzsy+DYPRRpZqpkXnoH6ymWXrS65cH0jqaWHZowoxHyG0zKg6PaO9ErHi4DvO/zQ9UqdQkPlRz9B2kFVYEsq0DJ45hpgY8AKaBlLAh4eYjnslIeq6WwcBcQ3Mvtn4Dc3+sHkw6YFSb0rVxHK1q2ev36l670EckEXxFGVH5wllt7QhS3Vf0NWuMbYdVu1HO1QEzrJo6okQK9IYR8OyAinZE4NDcSkQu1lBwRzB/yzNg2ueEg4MnfZbDAczr8xva6xDI+tBt6nK8+HrLdGplK4jTXNnb7Nbn3wDeYMEFoOKP6RhL1jHHEAKUHzH0NCabFEFzvKX3fvKVoG6jm3htTOcVMAqrVRpNV1FGbu+U3ghPj2EpM9GLsGXu+KBgB"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":10,"cache_creation_input_tokens":379,"cache_read_input_tokens":73952,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":379},"output_tokens":2,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXf59TnWVfZTUgsCkT33s","type":"assistant","uuid":"00979c0e-5506-4360-b22b-83d490cbef42","timestamp":"2026-01-31T07:36:51.245Z"}
