User wants to set up n8n stack on Hetzner\n2. I provided a detailed analysis of redundancies and asked clarifying questions\n3. The user needs to answer my questions about their use cases\n\nMy questions were:\n1. What's PocketBase for?\n2. What's NocoDB for?\n3. Do you need Coolify's UI?\n4. Supabase usage - app feature or backup?\n\nThe user would likely respond to these questions. They already gave a hint in their message with the example about PocketBase for local, Supabase for cloud backups, Google Drive for PDFs.\n\nGiven their example already showed their thinking, they might just confirm that approach or answer the questions. They seem technical and want to clarify the architecture before proceeding.\n\nThey might say something like:\n- \"pocketbase for local auth and realtime, nocodb for viewing workflow data, skip coolify use compose\"\n- Or they might confirm the simplified stack suggestion\n- Or provide their use cases\n\nGiven their style (lowercase, casual), they'd probably answer the questions concisely or confirm they want to proceed with the simplified approach.\n\nActually, looking at their example, they seem to already have a mental model. They might just confirm or say something like \"let's go with the simplified stack\" or answer specific use cases.\n\nTheir style is casual, lowercase. Something like:\n\"pocketbase for local apps, nocodb for data views, docker compose is fine, supabase just for backup\"\n\nOr simpler:\n\"let's go with the simplified stack\"\n\"docker compose is fine, skip coolify\"\n\nI think they'd confirm the direction or answer the questions.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":9,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2226,"cache_read_input_tokens":26281,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":2226},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXeuXRyK9kgGHTxquMAGg","type":"assistant","uuid":"cf8a7be2-670b-4d6f-9f7b-9a7171222c27","timestamp":"2026-01-31T05:30:43.728Z"}
