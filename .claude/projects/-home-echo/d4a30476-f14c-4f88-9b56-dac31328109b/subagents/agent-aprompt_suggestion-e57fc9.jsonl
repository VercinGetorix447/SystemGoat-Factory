They've been providing credentials and the server IP. Claude just asked for the root password.\n\nThe user has been fairly non-technical and has been providing credentials when asked. They just provided an API token, but that didn't work for accessing the server. Now Claude is asking for the root password.\n\nThe user would likely go check the Hetzner console for the root password and then paste it. They might also say something like \"checking now\" or \"one sec\" or just paste the password directly.\n\nSince the user has been cooperative in providing credentials, they're probably going to either:\n1. Go get the password and paste it\n2. Ask for help finding it\n\nGiven their pattern of just providing what's asked, they'll likely paste the password or ask where to find it if confused.\n\nI think they might say something like \"where do I find that\" or \"checking\" or just paste the password. But actually, since they said they're not that technical, they might need more guidance on where to find it.\n\nActually, looking at the pattern - they've been pretty responsive and just provide what's asked. They might just go get it and paste it, or say they're looking.\n\nI'll stay silent here since it's unclear - they need to take action (go find the password) and the next thing they type will depend on whether they find it or need more help. This isn't a clear \"obvious next step\" they would type - they need to go do something first.\n\nActually wait - they might ask for more help finding it since they said \"I am not that technical.\" They might type something like \"how do I reset the password\" or \"where is it in the console\"\n\nI'll suggest something related to finding the password since that's the blocker:","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":9,"cache_creation_input_tokens":459,"cache_read_input_tokens":49915,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":459},"output_tokens":4,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXezfTvh3ku8geHAgoBbx","type":"assistant","uuid":"22e05fe4-0cdc-4665-9062-9b98b3b9c7c1","timestamp":"2026-01-31T06:38:06.536Z"}
