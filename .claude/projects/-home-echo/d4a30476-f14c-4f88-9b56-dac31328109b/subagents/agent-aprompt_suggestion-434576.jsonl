They're non-technical and asked me to help them get credentials so I can automate things. Claude just gave them options on how to get SSH access.\n\nGiven the context:\n- User is non-technical\n- They want me to automate things\n- They're probably looking at the Hetzner console right now\n- Claude gave them two options: reset root password or create API token\n\nThe user would likely try one of these options. The API token is probably easier/cleaner. They might say something like \"here's the API token\" or \"I'll create the API token\" or just paste the token.\n\nActually, they might also just provide the SSH password if they found it, or ask for help finding it.\n\nGiven they said \"I am not that technical\" and want me to automate, they'd likely just try to get me what I need. The most natural response would be something like:\n\n- \"let me get the api token\"\n- \"creating api token now\"\n- \"here's the token\" (with token pasted)\n- Or they might ask for help: \"where do I find the root password\"\n\nI think the most likely is they'll try to create the API token since that was the second option and seems more straightforward. Or they might report back what they're seeing.\n\nActually, looking at the flow - the user has been pretty action-oriented. They'd likely just go do one of the things and paste the result. So maybe silence is appropriate, or a simple \"creating the api token\" type response.\n\nGiven their style (short, action-focused), I'd guess:\n\"let me create the api token\"\nor\n\"creating api token\"","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":9,"cache_creation_input_tokens":870,"cache_read_input_tokens":47874,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":870},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXeyhhBrPhgJgcpHZCL38","type":"assistant","uuid":"465ae60c-6687-4aa0-92b3-5b1aa7f0226c","timestamp":"2026-01-31T06:25:30.682Z"}
