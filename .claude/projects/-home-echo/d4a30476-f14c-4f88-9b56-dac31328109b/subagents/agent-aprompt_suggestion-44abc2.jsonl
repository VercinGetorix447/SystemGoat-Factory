Claude's last message asked what error they're seeing. The user might naturally clarify what happened or describe the error they're getting.\n\nBased on the flow, the user seems frustrated with Hostinger DNS. They mentioned nameserver changes taking 1-4 days. They might:\n1. Explain they did change nameservers \n2. Ask if there's another way\n3. Share what Hostinger is showing them\n\nGiven their earlier frustration with Hostinger (\"this is not allowing these in the manage\"), they might want to try a different approach or explain what's happening.\n\nActually, looking back - they asked about waiting 1-4 days for nameserver changes. This suggests they may have changed nameservers (not just A records). They might confirm this or ask what to do while waiting.\n\nThey could say something like \"I changed the nameservers\" or \"I'll wait for it to propagate\" or describe what they see.\n\nGiven their technical struggles, they might just want to move forward with something else while DNS propagates.\n\nI'll stay silent since the user needs to describe their situation - what error they're seeing or what they actually changed.
