They need to add DNS records at Hostinger. Claude gave them instructions. The user's natural next step would be to either:\n\n1. Tell Claude they added the records\n2. Ask for help with Hostinger since they mentioned they're not that technical\n3. Provide Hostinger credentials\n\nEarlier, the user offered to give Hostinger credentials to help automate things. They said \"let me give you credentials for Hetzner and Hostinger if that can help automate this.\"\n\nGiven they're not very technical and previously offered credentials, they might want help accessing Hostinger directly.\n\nMost likely response: \"here are my hostinger credentials\" or \"done\" after adding records, or asking for help.\n\nActually, looking at their style - short, direct messages - they'd probably just say something like \"done\" when finished, or ask for help if stuck.\n\nSince they just acknowledged the IPv4 point, they're probably going to go add the DNS records. The natural next message would be confirming they did it.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":10,"cache_creation_input_tokens":468,"cache_read_input_tokens":63762,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":468},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXf2G8fQndnkXaszYcaxt","type":"assistant","uuid":"21899ba2-a7b3-47f3-b477-0d1d27ca317e","timestamp":"2026-01-31T06:59:00.541Z"}
