I just asked them \"Can you tell me what you see under Servers → localhost?\" and they were sent a suggestion prompt. The user would likely respond with what they see in the UI - but since I asked them a question and they're in the middle of navigating Coolify, they would probably describe what they see or confirm they found the proxy settings.\n\nLooking at the conversation flow - I asked them to check Servers → localhost and look for Proxy. Their natural next response would be to tell me what they see, or if they found the proxy and what state it's in.\n\nSince I asked a question and they need to navigate and respond, the most natural thing would be for them to describe what they see. But that's not a suggestion I can provide - I need to suggest what THEY would type.\n\nMost likely they'd type something like:\n- \"proxy is running\" \n- \"I see proxy tab\"\n- \"found it\"\n- describing what they see\n\nActually, given the context, they might just be confirming they found it or asking what to do next. The most natural response based on their previous short confirmatory messages (\"saved\", \"ok\", \"logged in to coolify\") would be something brief.\n\nI'll stay silent since I just asked them a question and they need to assess what they see in the UI first.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":10,"cache_creation_input_tokens":518,"cache_read_input_tokens":73707,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":518},"output_tokens":3,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXf522M7ZU5iFWygZhU99","type":"assistant","uuid":"18765064-982e-4530-b9e2-4911f086c380","timestamp":"2026-01-31T07:35:12.136Z"}
