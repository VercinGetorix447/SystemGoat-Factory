I asked them to either download the JSON or paste the client secret.\n\nLooking at the conversation flow:\n- User wants to set up Google Drive MCP\n- I found their existing credentials (for cal + email)\n- User confirmed they'd get Drive OAuth credentials\n- User pasted a client ID\n- I asked for the client secret or full JSON file\n\nThe user would likely either:\n1. Paste the client secret\n2. Say they'll download the JSON\n3. Provide a path to where they saved the JSON\n\nSince I asked them to either download the JSON or paste the client secret, they'd probably do one of those. The most natural response would be pasting the secret or telling me they downloaded it.\n\nActually, this is a case where I should stay silent - the user needs to either paste the secret or download the file. They're likely doing that now and will provide the information.
