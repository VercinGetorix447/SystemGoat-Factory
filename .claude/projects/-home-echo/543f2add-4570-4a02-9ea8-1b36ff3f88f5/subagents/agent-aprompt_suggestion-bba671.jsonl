They were working on the session yesterday with Claude and apparently set up some subagents but I don't have that info. \n\nLooking at the conversation, they might want to:\n1. Tell me what the subagents were\n2. Move on to something else\n3. Check the Google Drive OAuth setup\n\nSince the agents folder is empty and I said I don't have records, they'd likely either tell me what they were or move on. Given they've been focused on setup and mentioned saving token usage, they might want to just store that info in memory now.\n\nActually, the most natural response might be for them to either:\n- Tell me what the subagents were so I can save them\n- Or move on to something else\n\nBut I don't have a clear signal what they'd type.
