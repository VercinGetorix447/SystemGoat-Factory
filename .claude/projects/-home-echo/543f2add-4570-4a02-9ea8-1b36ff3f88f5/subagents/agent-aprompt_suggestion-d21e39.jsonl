User was setting up Google Drive MCP\n2. We got to a point where OAuth consent screen needs test user added\n3. User asked about token usage and steps remaining\n4. I told them there are zero steps from me - they just need to add test user and restart\n\nThe natural next step would be for them to go do those manual steps (add test user in Google Cloud Console, restart Claude Code). After they do that, they might come back and test the Google Drive connection.\n\nBut they might also just say goodbye/thanks, or they might want to verify everything is working.\n\nGiven the context, I think the most natural thing they'd type after completing the manual steps would be to test if the Google Drive MCP is working. But that requires them to do manual steps first.\n\nActually, they might just end the session here since I said everything is configured and they need to do manual steps. Let me think about what they'd naturally type...\n\nThey could:\n- Say thanks and end\n- Ask to verify something\n- Come back after restarting to test gdrive\n\nGiven the conversation flow where they've been trying to minimize token usage and I just told them there are no more steps from me, they might just end the session or go do the manual steps.\n\nI think silence might be appropriate here since:\n1.
