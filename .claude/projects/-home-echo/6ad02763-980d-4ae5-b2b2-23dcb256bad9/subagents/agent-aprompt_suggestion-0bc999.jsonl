User said they have completed tasks I requested\n2. They asked me to check my memory for what we did before a break\n3. I searched but found nothing\n4. I asked them to remind me what we were working on\n\nThe natural response from them would be to fill me in on what we were doing previously. Since I asked them to remind me, they would likely explain or give context about our previous work.\n\nBut wait - the user is in \"suggestion mode\" - this is a meta-instruction asking me to predict what suggestion to show the user. Given that I asked them to remind me, the most natural thing for them to type would be an explanation of what we were working on.\n\nHowever, I don't know what we were working on, so I can't predict the specific content they'd type. The suggestion should be something generic that matches what they'd say.\n\nActually, looking at this more carefully - the user mentioned \"completed tasks that you requested\" - so they're coming back to tell me they finished something I asked them to do. They'd likely want to tell me about those completed tasks.\n\nA natural response might be something like:\n- \"we were working on...\" + context\n- \"you asked me to...\" + what they did\n\nBut I should stay silent if the next step isn't obvious. Since I genuinely don't know what we discussed, and they need to fill in context that only they know, maybe silence is appropriate here.\n\nActually, they said they have \"completed tasks\" - so they might want to tell me about those. A natural response could be \"we were setting up...\" or \"you asked me to install...\" or similar.\n\nI think staying silent is appropriate here since the user needs to provide specific context that I can't predict.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":10,"cache_creation_input_tokens":437,"cache_read_input_tokens":21338,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":437},"output_tokens":4,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXesZNivbU85P9U37FN89","type":"assistant","uuid":"3f36fa07-4fe3-4e75-a0d6-56fc14ad184d","timestamp":"2026-01-31T05:04:54.211Z"}
