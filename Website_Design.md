# DESIGN OVERVIEW

# WEBSITE DESIGN OVERVIEW

## SUMMARY

List of resources and overview and details of the website for the main site, as well as design elements to narrow down for the client sites' main choices and variables to group together

### CLIENT BUILD SITE

will need component blocks, listed on a page in sections for the items the client has access to in their plan (from pricing table filter. For example $396 6 page basic site including contact us page and gallery and team page, can add onto their pages with extra expense per static page of $69)

## DESIGN OVERVIEW

Example sites:  [Cal.com](http://Cal.com), [Clerk.io](http://Clerk.io), [Socrative.com](http://Socrative.com), [https://mailbakery.com/blog/](https://mailbakery.com/blog/), [https://demo.wpjobster.com/](https://demo.wpjobster.com/), [https://astoundify.com/](https://astoundify.com/), [dribbble.com](http://dribbble.com) 

Interpret creatively and have an overall smooth flowing, easy to read and navigate design that genuinely relates to the context when possible.  (eg: Avoid bouncing between dark and light themes).  
Always have a link to the “CONTACT US” page.   
Have a small box with contact us on the top right of footer of each page. Footer is sticky to every page.    
Have a 6 step, or less, process for monetization.  For example (popup banners on the right with a vertical ad and promotion upon scroll past 4 sections)

### FRONT-END AESTHETICS GUIDELINES

astro theme \- growth with starter template,   
CSS-tailwind.    
color theme examples: cal.com (background light gray with  
white high-contrast content boxes), sizing of images are compatible with the size of the text box vertically aligned (side by side).  
Clean open space between elements throughout (Example: https://www.socrative.com/)  
affiliate program page, become a partner page styles  
Avoid general AI-generated aesthetics like overused font families.  Do not use purple gradients. Stay with a plan that incorporates an overall theme that matches pages and font families to other sections. Do not cause confusion through wild font and design patterns that may cause users to bounce earlier than desired.  Every page should follow a clear pattern and end with a clear CTA.  Do not converge on common choices (eg: space grotesk)

### LAYOUT AND THEME DESIGN 

socrative.com \- clean layouts, javascript images on assessments, clean 4 verticals pricing comparison,   
elevanceai.com (long page layout, sticky menu, pricing comparison of 4 items,  
homebuddy ( dropdowns, content, SEO)  
brand colors (for client choices to have full color theme choices (but keep it very limited))

### TYPOGRAPHY

Header font style choices: “fonts” : \["titan one", "arial black", “google sans”\]  
“body text” : \[“trebuchet”, “montserrat”, “arial”\]

Choose fonts that are easy to read, beautiful and interesting. Stick with the fonts that are stable and reliable (transferable to other programs and have results working on multiple platforms).  

### THEME

Have a cohesive aesthetic to the theme. Use CSS variables for consistency.  Dominant colors with sharp accents in most cases will be preferable to evenly distributed palettes that look timid and fancy.  

### MOTIONS

Prioritize CSS solutions for HTML. Use motion library for React when available.  Request to add animation libraries if your research shows high potential for differentiation and it is easy to add to the design (eg: easily accessible libraries and/or repos, \<10 minutes to upload and create, \<1000 tokens to implement).  

Use high impact moments for motion additions: One well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals and slight animation delay instead of scattered, random micro interactions and animations.  Use scroll triggers and hover states to break monotony and create interest, but use them conservatively.

### SPATIAL COMPOSITION

Control density and avoid overlap, grid breaking elements and asymmetry.  Test visual compliance with responsive elements that will easily convert to mobile devices and desktop ones.  

Use H1, H2 and H3 tags to highlight distinct elements for ease of readability and navigation. Balance UX and fast loading with strong SEO and Google friendly.  Seek both simultaneously.  

### BACKGROUNDS AND VISUAL DEFAULTS 

Create depth and atmosphere.  Use light, yet tight shading to represent professional three dimensional elements on boxes and shapes. 

### MENUS

Use sticky top menus on each page for ease of navigation for the user.  Less than 7 choices on top menu frame.  Top right will have a login and settings gear icon. Start with one long page with menus navigating to that area instead of a new page, unless there is a strong case for separating pages.  Separate pages will be for detail and decision making aspects of the customer journey.  The main menu is for attention and interest.  Stick with easy to read fonts. Do not use drop down menus on hover or click. Do not use mega-menus.  

### IMAGES

Use large images that fit the text section aligned on the side of the image.  Use vector images when possible for scaling. If not a vector, check pixel count to avoid image distorted to an unprofessional level.    
Examples of some elements will be found on [Dribbble.com](https://dribbble.com/search/dashboard) (for example: charts and graph layouts can be found on this link: [dribbble.com/shots/605727-Infographic-Agro-Chart-Illustration-data-visualization](https://dribbble.com/shots/605727-Infographic-Agro-Chart-Illustration-data-visualization) , dashboards),  
123rf.com charts and graphics

## BLOG SECTION

mailbakery.com/blog (blog view of larger images of topics and a TOC on the side with LSA, contact form, and category boxes)

The images and titles for the main blog page will be much like the customer stories section of [Clerk.io](https://www.clerk.io/learn/customer-stories) customer stories section.  The top hero section should be one half the size of the one listed on [clerk.io](http://clerk.io) and not as tall so as users can see the top of the blog image boxes at the bottom of the screen.  

35 articles is the minimum number Google emphasizes in it’s algorithm for being eligible for higher page ranks based on content. The word count for each article should vary but averages of around 750 words is widely viewed as the norm.  Many SEO and business research firms have a wide array of opinions on this aspect, but it is widely accepted that random uploads and word counts are best for optimizing your ability for improved Google visibility.

## [CRM](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IN7JrKq2FEPWyILi9d70i48yqcjVUvZ97hxLFMSrsOY/edit?tab=t.78ohf3qclynk)

The CRM (details linked in CRM heading) will be available to users once they sign in.  Starter level members will have access to a basic CRM with to-do, table and kanban board views.  Features that can be added are the Expense Tracker with OCR capabilities that adds receipts and suggests pre-defined categories for expenses and saves the picture in a folder on the cloud, after automatic compression. The Expense tracker will be available to any level upon separate purchase/upgrade, but will be standard in the 3 higher tiers. The maps feature will be in the 2 top tiers but available for purchase in other tiers.  Other features will be added later and designated similarly, based on complexity and storage demands. 

## [MONETIZATION](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1uOpaodTUwQSIkI_AXLedOW0hXMRLqtP5Rnok--p7VAc/edit)

 Got it. Let me check the current state of the buildrightpros template to plan this work.

● Searched for 1 pattern, read 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

● Found the template structure. Let me read the current components to understand what we're working with.

● Read 5 files (ctrl+o to expand)

● Current state: Basic Astro \+ Tailwind template with Hero and ServiceCards. No animations.

  Est. tokens: \~450 | Task: Animations \+ 2 Landing Pages

  Proposed Plan

  1\. Animations (Tailwind CSS \- no extra deps)

  \- Fade-in on scroll for Hero headline/CTA  
  \- Slide-up stagger for ServiceCards  
  \- Hover scale on buttons/cards  
  \- Add keyframes to tailwind.config.mjs

  2\. Landing Pages (2 trades)

  Which 2 trades for initial pages?  
  \- Plumbing  
  \- Electrical  
  \- HVAC  
  \- Roofing  
  \- General Contractor  
  \- Other?

  Each page will include:  
  \- Trade-specific Hero with tagline  
  \- Services list for that trade  
  \- Trust signals (licensed, insured, etc.)  
  \- CTA / Contact form

  Proceed with animations \+ your choice of 2 trades?

✻ Baked for 30s

❯ for landing pages.  we want to test a few lower risk (to our business) by starting with ones that don't meet our  
  optimal scoring results.  here is the list of trades.  CARPENTRY

  PERSONAL TRAINING

  HAIR SALON

● Smart strategy \- test with lower-stakes trades first.

  Lower-risk options for testing (likely lower optimal scores):  
  ┌───────────────────┬────────────┐  
  │       Trade       │ Risk Level │  
  ├───────────────────┼────────────┤  
  │ Pool Cleaning     │ Low        │  
  ├───────────────────┼────────────┤  
  │ Cleaning          │ Low        │  
  ├───────────────────┼────────────┤  
  │ Personal Training │ Low        │  
  ├───────────────────┼────────────┤  
  │ Hair Salon        │ Low        │

  │ Pressure Washing  │ Low        │  
  ├───────────────────┼────────────┤  
  │ Tree Trimming     │ Low-Med    │  
  └───────────────────┴────────────┘  
  Higher-value trades to protect (save for after template is proven):  
  \- HVAC, Roofing, Plumbing, Electrical, Remodeling, Solar

  Pick 2 from the low-risk list for initial landing pages?

  My suggestion: Pressure Washing \+ Junk Removal \- simple services, easy to template, good variety (outdoor vs hauling).

❯ OK seems like good starts.  I will get some photos for those 2 industries to have a good hero image.

● Sounds good. I'll start on:

  1\. Animations \- Add to existing components now  
  2\. Landing page templates \- Pressure Washing \+ Junk Removal (placeholder hero images you can swap)
