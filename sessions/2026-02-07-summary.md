## TODO - Active

### Website Build (BuildRightPros.com)
- [x] Create testimonial carousel animation
  - 5 cards visible, center focused (larger + gold outline)
  - Auto-scrolls R→L every 3 seconds
  - Component: `/buildrightpros-template/src/components/core/TestimonialCarousel.astro`
- [x] Hero image gallery animation
  - 5 scattered rectangular images
  - Random highlight every 3 seconds
  - Active: 10% scale, glow, z-forward, fade transition
  - Component: `HeroGallery.astro`
- [x] Restyle to Clerk.io purple theme
  - Background: `#1a0a2e` (deep purple)
  - Accent: `#8b5cf6` (violet)
  - Updated tailwind.config.mjs
- [x] Blog page (Customer Stories)
  - Left sidebar TOC: search, categories, latest
  - Tag-based filtering + live search
  - Card grid with hover effects
- [ ] Additional animations (TBD)
- [ ] Design 2-3 initial landing pages for customer segments
- [ ] **Strategy:** Start with LOW-RISK customer groups to protect market position

### Landing Page Targeting (Priority Order)
1. Lower-risk segments first (test messaging/conversion)
2. Scale to higher-value segments after validation
3. Avoid damaging primary market during testing

## Notes
- Previous session had 9+ min image upload delay (possible network/WSL issue)
- Git remote has unrelated history - needs sync resolution

## Context Carry-Forward
- Primary: BuildRightPros.com (customer-facing)
- Utility: SystemGoat.com (backend)
- Animations + LP work = website build phase
