# Session: 2026-02-07

## TODO - Active

### Website Build (BuildRightPros.com)
- [x] Create testimonial carousel animation
  - 5 cards visible, center focused (larger + gold outline)
  - Auto-scrolls R→L every 3 seconds
  - Component: `/buildrightpros-template/src/components/core/TestimonialCarousel.astro`
- [ ] Additional animations (TBD)
- [ ] Design 2-3 initial landing pages for customer segments
- [ ] **Strategy:** Start with LOW-RISK customer groups to protect market position

### Landing Page Targeting (Priority Order)
1. Lower-risk segments first (test messaging/conversion)
2. Scale to higher-value segments after validation
3. Avoid damaging primary market during testing

## Notes
- Previous session had 9+ min image upload delay (possible network/WSL issue)
- Git remote has unrelated history - needs sync resolution

## Context Carry-Forward
- Primary: BuildRightPros.com (customer-facing)
- Utility: SystemGoat.com (backend)
- Animations + LP work = website build phase
