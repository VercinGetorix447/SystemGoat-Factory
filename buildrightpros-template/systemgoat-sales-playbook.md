## HOW TO USE THIS PLAYBOOK

Each service section is structured in the same order:

1. Cold Email Sequence (3 steps: initial, Day 3 follow-up, Day 7 break-up)
2. Phone Call Script (opener, discovery, objections, close)
3. SMS Templates (2–3 short messages)
4. Social DM Template (LinkedIn or Facebook, casual and value-first)

**The universal lead-in:** Every service starts with Reputation Management as the door-opener. If the prospect is already engaged on reputation, skip the rep management intro and go straight to the relevant service pitch.

**Personalization tokens to replace before sending:**
- [FIRST NAME] — prospect's first name
- [BUSINESS NAME] — their company name
- [TRADE] — their trade (plumber, roofer, electrician, etc.)
- [CITY] — their city
- [STAR RATING] — their current Google star rating if you looked it up
- [REVIEW COUNT] — their current number of Google reviews
- [YOUR NAME] — your name

---
---

# SERVICE 1: REPUTATION MANAGEMENT
**The flagship offer. Lead with this for every prospect, every channel.**

**The Core Pitch:**
Every [TRADE] in [CITY] is fighting for the same customers. The ones winning aren't always the best — they're the ones with the best online reputation. We put that on autopilot so you can focus on the actual work.

**LCV Math to Have Ready:**
If a [TRADE] business does $500K/year, a 1-star Google increase at even the low end (5%) = $25,000 in additional annual revenue. At the high end (9%) = $45,000. Our service costs a fraction of that.

### Email 1 — Initial Outreach

**Subject:** [BUSINESS NAME]'s Google reviews

---

Hi [FIRST NAME],

I looked up [BUSINESS NAME] on Google before reaching out.

[OPTION A — They have low stars:]
You're sitting at [STAR RATING] stars with [REVIEW COUNT] reviews. For a [TRADE] business in [CITY], that's costing you real money — 92% of customers only call businesses with 4+ stars, and businesses above 4 stars get 12x more clicks than those below it.

[OPTION B — They have few reviews:]
You only have [REVIEW COUNT] reviews. Most customers won't even call a [TRADE] business without seeing recent reviews — 73% of people only trust reviews from the last 30 days.

[OPTION C — They look fine but have no response to reviews:]
Your reviews look decent, but you haven't responded to a single one. 97% of customers read how businesses respond to reviews before deciding to call. That silence is working against you.

We help [TRADE] businesses like yours get more 5-star reviews on autopilot, respond to every review (good and bad), and protect your reputation across Google, Yelp, and Facebook — without you lifting a finger.

One client added 0.7 stars in 60 days. Based on industry data, that translated to roughly 12–15% more revenue from the same number of leads.

Are you open to a quick look at what that could mean for [BUSINESS NAME]?

### Email 2 — Day 3 Follow-Up

**Subject:** Re: [BUSINESS NAME]'s Google reviews

---

Hi [FIRST NAME],

Just bumping this up — wanted to make sure it didn't get buried.

Quick version of what I'm seeing: [BUSINESS NAME] is leaving real money on the table right now because your online reputation isn't working for you the way it could be.

We handle everything: automated review requests after every job, monitoring across platforms, professional responses to every review, and a dashboard so you always know where you stand.

No monthly maintenance. No tasks for you or your team. It just runs.

Is this something worth a 15-minute conversation? Just reply and I'll send a few times.

[YOUR NAME]

---

### Email 3 — Day 7 Break-Up

**Subject:** Closing the loop on [BUSINESS NAME]

---

Hi [FIRST NAME],

I'll keep this short — I know you're busy.

I reached out because I genuinely think [BUSINESS NAME] is losing customers right now that you'd otherwise win, just because of how your online reputation looks to a cold prospect.

If that's not a priority right now, no worries at all. I'll stop following up.

But if you ever want to see exactly what we'd do for you, the door's open. Just reply with "yes" and I'll put something together.

Either way, hope the [TRADE] business is going well.

## 1B — Phone Call Script (Reputation Management)

**Best time to call:** Tuesday–Thursday, 10–11 AM or 4–5 PM in prospect's time zone.
**Talk ratio goal:** You talk 46%, they talk 54%. Ask, then listen. Shut up after asking.

---

**OPENER (warm, human — not a pitch):**

"Hey [FIRST NAME], how've you been?"

[Let them respond. Do not jump into pitch.]

"Good to hear. Hey, this is [YOUR NAME] from SystemGoat — I do digital marketing for [TRADE] businesses. I'll be straightforward: I looked up [BUSINESS NAME] before calling and I noticed something that I think is worth a quick conversation. Do you have two minutes or is this a bad time?"

[If bad time:] "No problem at all — when's a better time to call? I'll put it in my calendar."

[If they have time:]

---

**DISCOVERY (ask these — don't rush past them):**

"So let me ask you — when someone calls you for the first time, do you know how they found you? Like, is it Google, a referral, Facebook, what?"

[Listen. Note what they say.]

"And what does your Google profile look like right now — do you know what you're sitting at for stars and reviews?"

[Listen. If they don't know, that's your hook:]
"That's actually really common — most business owners haven't checked lately. What I usually find when I look is [use what you saw before calling]."

"How often do customers mention your reviews when they call?"

[Listen.]

"Got it. So my last question before I tell you what I'm seeing — if I could show you that your reputation is costing you jobs right now, would that be something worth fixing?"

---

**THE PITCH (brief — 2 minutes max):**

"Here's what I'm seeing on your profile. [State the specific issue — low stars, few reviews, no responses.] Based on the data, businesses in your space with less than a 4-star average get passed over by 92% of people searching Google. You might be getting the call, but losing it to a competitor with better reviews before you even answer.

What we do is put your reputation management completely on autopilot. After every job, your customer automatically gets a review request. We monitor every platform. We respond to every review — good and bad — with a professional response. You never have to touch it.

Most of our clients see a meaningful star increase within 60–90 days. At even a 5% revenue lift from that, on a business doing [estimated revenue], that's real money."

---

**OBJECTION HANDLING:**

**"How much does it cost?"**
"Before I give you a number, let me ask — if a half-star increase in your Google rating brought in an extra $20,000 this year, what would you pay per month to make that happen? [Pause.] Our reputation management starts at $[PRICE]/month. That's less than most businesses spend on fuel in a week. And the ROI on the first client it wins you more than pays for the first year."

**"We're doing fine, we don't need this."**
"That's great to hear — I mean that. But let me ask you something: if you're doing fine now and we could put 10–15% more revenue on top of that by getting your online reputation to do the heavy lifting, would that be worth looking at? Most businesses I talk to think they're fine until they see the data."

**"I'm not interested."**
"I completely understand. Can I ask — is it that reviews aren't a priority right now, or is it more that you're already handling it some other way?" [Listen. If no way, re-engage. If genuinely not interested:] "Fair enough. I'll leave it there. If you ever want to see what your profile looks like from a customer's perspective, just give me a call. Take care."

---

**THE CLOSE:**

"So here's what I'd suggest — let me put together a quick snapshot of exactly where [BUSINESS NAME] stands right now versus the top [TRADE] businesses in [CITY], and what the revenue gap looks like. Takes me about 15 minutes to pull together and it's completely free. Would that be useful?"

[If yes:] "Perfect. I can send that over by [day]. What's the best email?"

[If they want to move forward:] "Great. I can get you set up this week. I'll send over a short onboarding form — takes about 10 minutes to fill out — and we'll have your first automated review request running by [timeframe]."

## 1C — SMS Templates (Reputation Management)

**Message 1 — Cold intro:**
"Hey [FIRST NAME] — this is [YOUR NAME] from SystemGoat. I looked up [BUSINESS NAME] on Google and noticed something I think is worth a quick conversation. Mind if I send a short email? —[YOUR NAME]"

**Message 2 — After no email reply (Day 3):**
"Hey [FIRST NAME], sent you an email a few days ago about [BUSINESS NAME]'s Google reviews. Worth 2 mins of your time. Reply YES and I'll send a free snapshot of where you stand vs. competitors in [CITY]."

**Message 3 — Re-engagement (if prospect went cold):**
"[FIRST NAME] — [YOUR NAME] from SystemGoat. Quick question: how many 5-star Google reviews did [BUSINESS NAME] get last month? If the answer is 'not many,' I can fix that. Happy to show you how."

---

## 1D — Social DM Template (Facebook / LinkedIn)

**Facebook (business owner — casual):**

"Hey [FIRST NAME] — saw [BUSINESS NAME] come up when I was looking at [TRADE] businesses in [CITY].

Looked at your Google reviews and wanted to flag something I see a lot with trades businesses: you've got solid reviews but nothing recent, and that's actually hurting you more than a bad review would. 73% of customers won't trust reviews older than 30 days.

We help [TRADE] businesses get a steady stream of fresh 5-star reviews on autopilot — no work on your end.

Not pitching you anything right now, just thought it was worth a heads-up. Happy to show you what I'd do differently if you're curious."

**LinkedIn (more professional):**

"Hi [FIRST NAME],

I specialize in helping local trades businesses grow their revenue through better online reputation management — specifically Google reviews and multi-platform monitoring.

I ran a quick check on [BUSINESS NAME] before sending this and [specific observation: low stars / few reviews / no responses]. Based on industry data, that's likely costing you a measurable percentage of inbound leads.

I put together a free competitive snapshot for trades businesses in specific markets — no strings attached. Worth a look?

# SERVICE 2: AI RECEPTIONIST
**Best pitch after:** Rep management engagement, or any prospect who mentions missing calls.

**The Core Pitch:**
Your phone is your business. Every missed call is a missed job. We install a 24/7 AI receptionist that answers every call, qualifies the lead, books the appointment, and texts the customer a confirmation — while you're on the job.

**Numbers to have ready:**
- Trades businesses miss ~27% of inbound calls
- Each missed call = ~$1,200 in lost revenue (industry average)
- AI receptionist: $199–$299/month vs. $35,000+/year for a human
- 93–95% cost reduction, 24/7 coverage
- 24% average improvement in customer retention with always-available reception

---

## 2A — Cold Email Sequence (AI Receptionist)

---

### Email 1

**Subject:** You missed 3 calls while reading this

---

Hi [FIRST NAME],

That subject line is a little dramatic, but the math isn't far off.

Trades businesses miss an average of 27% of inbound calls. For a [TRADE] company doing steady volume, that's not a small number — each missed call is roughly $1,200 in lost revenue on average.

Most [TRADE] business owners aren't ignoring those calls. You're just on the job. On the roof. Under the sink. Knee-deep in whatever job you're actually running.

We install an AI receptionist for [TRADE] businesses that answers 100% of calls, 24/7. It qualifies leads, books appointments directly to your calendar, and texts the customer a confirmation. You finish the job, you open your calendar, new booking is there.

Cost: a fraction of hiring an answering service. Less than $300/month for unlimited calls, versus $35,000+ a year for a front desk person.

Would it be worth 15 minutes to see if this fits [BUSINESS NAME]?

[YOUR NAME]

### Email 2 — Day 3

**Subject:** Re: missed calls at [BUSINESS NAME]

---

Hi [FIRST NAME],

Quick follow-up on my last note.

I know this might not be on your radar right now, but here's a simple math exercise:

If [BUSINESS NAME] gets 10 calls a week and misses 3 of them, that's roughly 150 missed calls a year. At an average job value of even $400, that's $60,000 walking out the door.

Our AI receptionist would have caught every single one of those.

Happy to walk you through exactly how it works in 15 minutes — no tech setup required on your end, we handle all of it.

Worth a conversation?

[YOUR NAME]

---

### Email 3 — Day 7

**Subject:** Last note from me, [FIRST NAME]

---

Hi [FIRST NAME],

Wrapping up my outreach here.

I reached out because missed calls are quietly one of the biggest revenue leaks for [TRADE] businesses, and I think [BUSINESS NAME] might be feeling that without realizing the source.

If it's ever a priority, we can have an AI receptionist running for you in less than a week, for less than what most businesses spend on a single technician's lunch.

My contact info is below. Door's open.

## 2B — Phone Call Script (AI Receptionist)

**OPENER:**
"Hey [FIRST NAME], how've you been? This is [YOUR NAME] from SystemGoat — we work with [TRADE] businesses on their operations. Quick question before I explain why I'm calling: when you're out on a job and your phone rings, what happens to that call?"

[Listen. This opens the pain point immediately.]

**DISCOVERY:**
"So roughly how many calls does [BUSINESS NAME] get in a week? Just a ballpark."
"And when you can't answer, does it go to voicemail? Do customers leave messages?"
"How often do you think you're missing calls?"
"Have you ever had a customer tell you they called but couldn't reach you?"

**PIVOT TO PITCH:**
"Here's why I ask. The industry data for [TRADE] businesses shows roughly 27% of calls go unanswered. Each one of those is a potential job. We install an AI receptionist that catches every one of them — answers the call, qualifies the lead, books them directly to your calendar, sends them a confirmation text. You get a notification. You finish the job. New booking is waiting for you when you look up.

The whole thing runs for less than $300 a month. A full-time receptionist runs $35,000 to $60,000 a year. And ours never takes a sick day."

**OBJECTIONS:**

**"Customers won't want to talk to a robot."**
"That's the most common concern I hear, and I get it. The reality is — the AI sounds natural, it asks the right questions, and it gets the job booked. What customers actually hate is getting no answer and having to call three competitors. An AI that picks up at 9 PM beats a voicemail every time. We can show you exactly how it sounds before you commit."

**"We already have someone handling calls."**
"That's great — so what happens when they're off? Evenings, weekends, sick days? That's when the most motivated customers call, because they have an emergency. We can work alongside your existing setup and just cover the gaps."

**"It sounds expensive."**
"Let me flip that around. If the AI catches just one extra job a month that would have gone to voicemail — at even $400 for a basic job — it's paid for itself. Most businesses see it pay for 2–3 months in the first week."

**CLOSE:**
"What I'd like to do is set up a quick demo so you can hear exactly how it sounds on a call. Takes 20 minutes. I'll set it up using a fake scenario from your business so you can hear it in context. Does [day] or [day] work for you?"

---

## 2C — SMS Templates (AI Receptionist)

**Message 1:**
"Hey [FIRST NAME] — [YOUR NAME] from SystemGoat. Quick Q: how many calls does [BUSINESS NAME] miss per week while you're on jobs? There's a $300/month fix for that. Worth 10 mins? —[YOUR NAME]"

**Message 2:**
"[FIRST NAME] — if [BUSINESS NAME] is missing even 2 calls a week, that's potentially $40K+ in lost revenue per year. We install an AI receptionist that catches all of them. Want a free demo?"

---

## 2D — Social DM Template (AI Receptionist)

"Hey [FIRST NAME],

I work with [TRADE] businesses in [CITY] and the number one thing I keep hearing is 'I was on a job and missed the call.'

We install AI receptionists for trades businesses — answers every call 24/7, qualifies leads, books straight to your calendar. Costs less than $300/month vs. $35K+ for a human.

Not pitching you hard here — just curious if missed calls are something [BUSINESS NAME] deals with. Happy to show you how it sounds if so."

---
---

# SERVICE 3: LEAD MANAGEMENT & DIRECT BOOKINGS
**Best pitch after:** AI Receptionist, or any prospect who mentions losing leads or slow follow-up.

**The Core Pitch:**
Getting the lead is only half the battle. If it takes you 24 hours to follow up, the customer already hired someone else. We build a system that follows up in minutes, qualifies the lead automatically, and puts a confirmed booking on your calendar before your competitor even calls back.

**Numbers to have ready:**
- Speed-to-lead: responding within 5 minutes makes you 100x more likely to connect vs. responding within 30 minutes
- 78% of customers buy from the first business that responds
- Average trades business follow-up time: 24–47 hours

---

## 3A — Cold Email Sequence (Lead Management)

---

### Email 1

**Subject:** [BUSINESS NAME] follow-up speed

---

Hi [FIRST NAME],

Here's a stat that might sting a little: responding to a new lead within 5 minutes makes you 100x more likely to connect than responding 30 minutes later.

For most [TRADE] businesses, the average follow-up time is closer to 24–47 hours. By then, the customer has already hired someone else.

We build lead management systems for [TRADE] businesses that respond to every new inquiry in under 5 minutes — automatically. Text, email, or both. The lead gets qualified, they book directly to your calendar, and you get a notification. You don't have to do anything.

The businesses we've set this up for have seen a significant lift in close rate from the same number of leads — just because they're first in line.

Is this something you've thought about for [BUSINESS NAME]?

[YOUR NAME]
SystemGoat.com

---

### Email 2 — Day 3

**Subject:** The 5-minute rule for [BUSINESS NAME]

---

Hi [FIRST NAME],

Quick follow-up. The 5-minute rule I mentioned isn't a marketing claim — it's from Harvard Business Review research on B2C lead conversion.

78% of customers buy from the first business that responds. Not the cheapest. Not the one with the best reviews. The first one to pick up or reply.

We can make [BUSINESS NAME] that first responder, automatically, 24/7 — even while you're on a job.

Worth a 15-minute conversation?

[YOUR NAME]

---

### Email 3 — Day 7

**Subject:** Last note — [BUSINESS NAME]

---

Hi [FIRST NAME],

Last one from me. Just want to leave you with this:

Every week you don't have a fast follow-up system, you're giving leads to your competitors — not because they're better, but because they replied first.

If you ever want to fix that, I can have a system running for [BUSINESS NAME] in about a week. No tech knowledge required.

## 3B — Phone Call Script (Lead Management)

**OPENER:**
"Hey [FIRST NAME], how've you been? [YOUR NAME] from SystemGoat — we build lead systems for [TRADE] businesses. Quick question: when someone fills out your contact form or calls and you miss it, how quickly does your team typically follow up?"

[Listen. Most will say "when we get around to it" or give a vague answer.]

**DISCOVERY:**
"Got it. And what does your current lead flow look like — are most of your leads coming through Google, referrals, your website, social?"
"When you do follow up, what's the close rate like on cold leads versus warm referrals?"
"Have you ever lost a job where you found out later the customer went with a competitor — and you only found out they were even looking after they'd already hired someone?"

**PITCH:**
"The data on this is pretty stark. Responding within 5 minutes makes you 100x more likely to actually connect with that lead versus waiting 30 minutes. Most businesses are taking a day or more. By then, the customer has already made a decision.

We build an automated lead management system that responds within minutes, every time, regardless of whether you're available. It qualifies the lead, sends them a booking link, and drops the appointment on your calendar. You close more of the same leads you're already paying to get."

**OBJECTIONS:**

**"We handle follow-up ourselves."**
"That's great — how fast? Because if there's any gap at all — evenings, weekends, you're busy on a job — that's when motivated leads slip through. We're not replacing you, just making sure nothing falls through."

**"We get enough work already."**
"Perfect — then this is about efficiency. Same leads, higher close rate, less time chasing. Or it frees you up to raise your prices because you can be selective."

**CLOSE:**
"Let me ask you this — if I could show you, based on your current lead volume, what a 20% improvement in close rate would mean in dollars this year, would that be worth looking at? I can put that together for free. Want me to send it over?"

---

## 3C — SMS Templates (Lead Management)

**Message 1:**
"Hey [FIRST NAME] — [YOUR NAME] from SystemGoat. Did you know 78% of customers hire the first business that responds to their inquiry? We help [TRADE] businesses be that first response — automatically. Worth a quick chat?"

**Message 2:**
"[FIRST NAME] — how fast does [BUSINESS NAME] follow up on new leads? If it's more than 5 mins, you're losing jobs to competitors. We can fix that automatically. Reply if curious."

---

## 3D — Social DM Template (Lead Management)

"Hey [FIRST NAME],

Quick question for you — when a new lead comes through for [BUSINESS NAME] after hours or on a weekend, what happens to it?

The research is pretty clear that the business that responds first wins the job 78% of the time — not the cheapest, not the most experienced. Just the fastest.

We set up automated lead response and direct booking systems for [TRADE] businesses so you never lose a lead to slow follow-up. Happy to show you how it works if it sounds relevant."

# SERVICE 4: LANDING PAGES & WEBSITE BUILDS
**Best pitch after:** Reputation Management (they need somewhere to send all that review traffic), or any prospect without a website or with a terrible one.

**The Core Pitch:**
Your Google reviews are sending customers to your website. If your website looks like it's from 2009, loads slow on a phone, or doesn't have a "call now" button in the first 3 seconds — you're losing them. We build fast, mobile-first websites for [TRADE] businesses that convert visitors into calls.

**Numbers to have ready:**
- 53% of mobile users leave if a page takes longer than 3 seconds to load
- 75% of people judge business credibility based on website design
- Mobile accounts for 63%+ of all local business searches

## 4A — Cold Email Sequence (Website/Landing Page)

### Email 1

**Subject:** Loaded [BUSINESS NAME]'s site on my phone

---

Hi [FIRST NAME],

I pulled up [BUSINESS NAME]'s website on my phone this morning before reaching out.

[OPTION A — No website:] You don't have one. In 2026, that means you're invisible to anyone who hasn't gotten your number from a friend. Every customer who Googles "[TRADE] in [CITY]" is going to a competitor.

[OPTION B — Slow/outdated site:] It took [X] seconds to load, and I had to zoom in to read anything. 53% of mobile visitors leave if a page takes more than 3 seconds to load. And mobile is where 63% of local searches happen.

[OPTION C — No clear call to action:] There's no click-to-call button visible in the first few seconds. On a mobile device, if I can't tap to call in 3 seconds, I'm already looking at your competitor.

We build fast, professional, mobile-first websites specifically for [TRADE] businesses. They're designed to convert visitors into calls — not just look pretty. Most projects are complete and live within 2 weeks.

Worth a look?

### Email 2 — Day 3

**Subject:** Re: [BUSINESS NAME]'s site

---

Hi [FIRST NAME],

Following up on my last note. 75% of people judge business credibility by website design — before they ever read a review or make a call.

Your Google reputation is doing the heavy lifting to get customers to click. The website is where they decide to actually call or not. It's worth making sure it closes the deal.

We specialize in [TRADE] business websites — fast, mobile-optimized, built to get the phone ringing. Happy to show you some examples from businesses in your space.

15 minutes?

[YOUR NAME]

### Email 3 — Day 7

**Subject:** One last note

---

Hi [FIRST NAME],

Last message from me. Quick thought:

Your reputation management and your website are a team. Your reviews bring customers in. Your website closes them. If one of them isn't working, the other one can't carry the whole load.

If you ever want to see what a rebuilt version of your site could look like, I'm happy to put together a concept — no commitment, no cost.

[YOUR NAME]

## 4B — Phone Call Script (Website/Landing Page)

**OPENER:**
"Hey [FIRST NAME], how've you been? [YOUR NAME] from SystemGoat. I build websites for [TRADE] businesses and I pulled up yours before calling. I had a quick observation — is this a bad time?"

**DISCOVERY:**
"How are most of your customers finding you right now — Google, referrals, word of mouth?"
"Do you have any sense of how many people visit your site per month? Or what percentage of visitors actually call you?"
"When you think about your website, what's the one thing you wish it did better?"

**PITCH:**
"Here's what I'm seeing. [State specific issue.] The websites that actually convert visitors into calls for [TRADE] businesses have three things: they load in under 3 seconds on mobile, there's a click-to-call button you can see immediately, and they look credible enough to build trust fast. A lot of trades websites are missing at least one of those three. We fix all three."

**OBJECTIONS:**

**"I already have a website."**
"Completely understand — most businesses do. What I'm asking is whether it's working as hard as it could be. Do you know what your site's conversion rate is? If you're getting 100 visitors a month and 2 of them call, that's 2%. If we got that to 6%, that's three times as many leads from the same traffic. That's usually worth the conversation."

**"It's too expensive."**
"Our builds are priced specifically for trades businesses — not enterprise pricing. And I'd push back a bit on the framing: if the website brings in one extra job a month, how long before it's paid for itself? For most of our clients, it's paid off in the first 60 days."

**CLOSE:**
"Here's what I'd like to do — let me put together a quick mock-up of what a rebuilt version of your homepage could look like, based on your trade and your market. It takes me a couple hours and costs you nothing. If you like it, we talk next steps. If not, you've lost nothing. Does that sound fair?"

"Hey [FIRST NAME],

I do website builds for [TRADE] businesses and I came across [BUSINESS NAME] while looking at [TRADE] companies in [CITY].

I pulled up your site on my phone — [specific honest observation].

The goal of a trades website is pretty simple: get the visitor to call. Everything else is secondary. We build websites specifically for that goal — fast, mobile-first, with a clear path to booking.

Not everyone needs a full rebuild. Sometimes it's just a few changes. Happy to take a look and give you an honest read, no cost."

# SERVICE 5: CRM INTEGRATION
**Best pitch after:** Lead Management, Website Build, or any prospect drowning in spreadsheets.

**The Core Pitch:**
You're probably managing your customers in a spreadsheet. Or your head. That means you're forgetting follow-ups, losing repeat business, and leaving referrals uncaptured. We set up a simple CRM that works the way your business actually works — we handle the whole setup.

**Numbers to have ready:**
- 65% of sales come from existing customers
- It costs 5x more to acquire a new customer than to retain one
- A 5% increase in customer retention = 25–95% increase in profit (Bain & Company)

### Email 1

**Subject:** How does [BUSINESS NAME] track repeat customers?

---

Hi [FIRST NAME],

Simple question: if a customer who used [BUSINESS NAME] 18 months ago is now ready for another job, would you know to reach out to them? Would you have their contact info ready? Would they get a follow-up from you, or would they Google someone else?

65% of revenue for service businesses comes from repeat customers. But most [TRADE] businesses have no system to capture, track, or re-engage that list.

We set up a simple CRM — not a painful 6-month implementation — for [TRADE] businesses. It connects to your existing tools. We do the whole setup. You get a working system in about a week that lets you see every customer, every job, every follow-up that's due.

Is this something [BUSINESS NAME] has tried to solve before?

### Email 2 — Day 3

**Subject:** Re: [BUSINESS NAME] customer tracking

---

Hi [FIRST NAME],

One more data point worth knowing: it costs 5x more to get a new customer than to keep an existing one. And a 5% improvement in retention can increase profit by 25–95%.

Most [TRADE] businesses focus entirely on new leads — because that's where the urgency is. But the repeat customer list is almost always worth more.

A simple CRM solves this. We handle the setup. You get a working system.

Worth 15 minutes?

Hi [FIRST NAME],

Last message on this.

The thing I've noticed with [TRADE] businesses is that you're usually so good at the actual work that the business side — tracking customers, following up, building that repeat base — gets pushed to the back burner.

If that ever becomes a priority, a CRM doesn't have to be complicated. We make it simple and handle the heavy lifting.

**OPENER:**
"Hey [FIRST NAME], how've you been? [YOUR NAME] from SystemGoat. We help [TRADE] businesses set up simple systems to track their customers and grow repeat business. Quick question before I go further — how are you currently keeping track of your customer list?"

**DISCOVERY:**
"And when a job is complete, is there any kind of follow-up that goes out automatically — a review request, a seasonal offer, anything like that?"
"If I asked you right now how many customers you've served in the last 12 months, could you pull that up easily?"
"What percentage of your business right now would you say is repeat customers versus new?"

**PITCH:**
"The businesses that grow fastest aren't always the best at getting new leads — they're the best at keeping the customers they already have. 65% of service business revenue comes from repeat customers. The CRM we set up for [TRADE] businesses makes that automatic — track every job, flag when a follow-up is due, run re-engagement messages to customers you haven't heard from in a while. We handle the entire setup. You get a working system in about a week."

**CLOSE:**
"What I'd like to do is walk you through what the setup would look like specifically for [BUSINESS NAME] — your workflow, your customer base. Takes about 20 minutes. If it makes sense, we move forward. If not, you've gotten a free look at how your competitors are managing this. Worth it?"

"Hey [FIRST NAME],

I set up CRM systems for [TRADE] businesses and the conversation always starts the same way: 'We track customers in a spreadsheet' or 'I kind of just remember them.'

That works until it doesn't — and then you realize you've been leaving repeat business on the table for years.

The setup isn't as complicated as most people think. We handle everything. A week later you have a working system that tracks every customer and tells you when to follow up.

Not sure if this fits where [BUSINESS NAME] is right now — just thought it was worth mentioning."

# SERVICE 6: SOCIAL MEDIA MANAGEMENT
**Best pitch after:** Website build, or any prospect who hasn't posted in 3+ months (check before reaching out).

**The Core Pitch:**
You don't need to go viral. You need to show up consistently enough that when someone in your area is thinking about hiring a [TRADE], they've seen your name recently. We handle all of it — content, posting, responding — so you never have to think about it.

**Numbers to have ready:**
- 54% of people browse social media before purchasing from a local business
- Consistent posting increases page reach by 3–5x compared to sporadic posting
- Responding to social comments increases customer spend by an average of 20–40%

### Email 1

**Subject:** [BUSINESS NAME]'s last Instagram post

---

Hi [FIRST NAME],

I looked at [BUSINESS NAME]'s social profiles before reaching out.

[OPTION A — Last post was months ago:] Your last post was [X months] ago. That's not a criticism — you've been busy running a business. But from a customer's perspective, a dormant social page reads like a business that might not be active.

[OPTION B — No social presence:] You're not on [platform] at all. 54% of people check social media before hiring a local service business. Without a presence, you're just not in the conversation.

[OPTION C — Active but inconsistent:] Your posting is inconsistent — a few posts, then a gap, then a few more. That inconsistency actually hurts reach more than posting slowly and steadily.

We manage social media for [TRADE] businesses end to end: content creation, scheduling, posting, responding to comments. You never have to log in unless you want to.

Hi [FIRST NAME],

Following up briefly. The goal of social media for a [TRADE] business isn't viral videos — it's just consistent visibility.

When someone in [CITY] is thinking "I need a [TRADE]," you want them to have seen your name recently. That's it. Consistent posts — before-and-after photos, quick tips, job highlights — keep [BUSINESS NAME] top of mind.

We handle all of that. You approve a monthly content plan once and we do the rest.

Hi [FIRST NAME],

Last one from me on this.

I've talked to a lot of [TRADE] business owners who say social media "doesn't work" for them. Usually what I find is that they posted for a month, stopped, then concluded it didn't work. Consistency is the actual product.

If you ever want to hand that off completely and just watch the page grow, that's exactly what we do.

When it comes to social media for the business, is that something you actively manage, something you've been meaning to get to, or something you've basically written off?"

**DISCOVERY:**
"How do you currently think about social media for [BUSINESS NAME] — is it a marketing channel for you, or more of a checkbox?"
"When new customers find you, are any of them coming through Facebook or Instagram?"
"If you had to guess, when was the last time you posted something?"

**PITCH:**
"Here's the honest pitch: for a [TRADE] business, social media isn't about going viral. It's about being seen consistently enough that when someone in [CITY] thinks 'I need a [TRADE],' your name comes to mind because they've seen you recently. We post for you, respond to comments for you, build the page for you. You see a monthly plan once and approve it — that's the only time you touch it."

**OBJECTIONS:**

"I hear that a lot, and it's usually tied to an experience of inconsistent posting that didn't pan out.

# SERVICE 7: SEO & AI SEARCH OPTIMIZATION
**Best pitch after:** Website build, or any prospect asking about "getting found on Google."
**URGENCY NOTE: Lead with the AI search angle — this is genuinely time-sensitive in 2026.**

**The Core Pitch:**
Google is changing how it surfaces local businesses, and AI search engines like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google's AI Overview are already sending traffic based on completely different signals than traditional SEO. Businesses that optimize now will own that space. Businesses that wait will be starting from scratch while competitors are already ranked.

**Numbers to have ready:**
- 46% of all Google searches are local
- Businesses in the top 3 of local search get 75% of the clicks
- Google's AI Overview now appears in 47%+ of searches and pulls from different sources than traditional search
- Citation consistency (NAP — Name, Address, Phone) is one of the top 3 local ranking factors

### Email 1

**Subject:** How AI is changing who finds [BUSINESS NAME]

---

Hi [FIRST NAME],

Something shifted in local search in the last 12 months and most [TRADE] businesses haven't caught up yet.

Google now shows an AI Overview at the top of search results for most local queries. It pulls from different sources than traditional search rankings — structured data, citations, reviews, content signals. If [BUSINESS NAME] isn't optimized for those signals, you're invisible at the top of the page where 75% of the clicks go.

This isn't a distant future thing. It's happening now. The businesses that act in the next 6–12 months will own those positions. The businesses that wait will spend years trying to catch up.

We do SEO and AI search optimization specifically for [TRADE] businesses — the technical fixes, the citation building, the content strategy, all of it. And we track what's working so you're not flying blind.

Is this something [BUSINESS NAME] is thinking about?

Hi [FIRST NAME],

Quick follow-up. 46% of all Google searches have local intent — "plumber near me," "best roofer in [CITY]." The businesses that show up in the top 3 results get 75% of the clicks. Everyone else fights over the scraps.

Right now, where is [BUSINESS NAME] showing up when someone searches for a [TRADE] in [CITY]?

If you don't know, that's worth finding out. We do a free local search audit — takes us about 30 minutes to pull together — and we'll show you exactly where you stand and what it would take to move up.

[Listen. Most don't know.]

**PITCH:**
"Here's what I'm seeing in your market. [Either they rank well and you focus on AI search, or they don't rank and you focus on that.] The biggest shift right now is that Google and other AI search tools — ChatGPT, Perplexity — are pulling local business recommendations from a different set of signals than traditional SEO. Reviews, citations, structured data, content. The businesses that are visible there are capturing traffic that doesn't even make it to the traditional search results. We optimize for both."

**URGENCY PITCH:**
"The reason I'm emphasizing this now: the window to establish early authority in AI search for [CITY] [TRADE] is probably 6–12 months before it gets competitive.

# SERVICE 8: WORKFLOW AUTOMATION
**Best pitch after:** Any service, particularly CRM or Lead Management — automation is the natural next layer.

**The Core Pitch:**
You're doing things manually every day that a machine could do in seconds. Review requests, follow-up texts, job confirmations, invoice reminders, scheduling — we map your workflow and automate the repetitive parts. Most clients save 5–10 hours a week in the first 30 days.

**Numbers to have ready:**
- Average small business owner spends 40% of time on administrative tasks
- Automating follow-ups reduces time-to-response from hours to minutes
- Businesses that automate lead follow-up are 3x more likely to convert that lead
- ROI: 5 hours/week saved at $50 equivalent value = $13,000/year in recovered time

### Email 1

**Subject:** What [BUSINESS NAME] does manually every day

---

Hi [FIRST NAME],

A question worth thinking about: what's the most repetitive thing you or your team does every single day in the business?

For most [TRADE] businesses it's some combination of: calling back leads, texting job confirmations, reminding customers of appointments, sending invoices, requesting reviews after jobs, following up on unpaid invoices.

Every one of those can be automated. And not in a "we'll build it over 6 months" way — in a "it's running by next week" way.

We build custom workflow automations for [TRADE] businesses. Most clients recover 5–10 hours per week in the first month. That's time back for you, or for the jobs you're not taking because you're doing admin.

What does that kind of time recovery look like for [BUSINESS NAME]?

[YOUR NAME]
SystemGoat.com

### Email 2 — Day 3

**Subject:** Re: automating [BUSINESS NAME]'s workflow

---

Hi [FIRST NAME],

Quick math I put together for a [TRADE] business similar to yours:

5 hours/week recovered through automation, valued at a modest $50/hour equivalent, is $13,000/year. That's before accounting for faster follow-up, fewer missed leads, and the business owner actually getting time back.

We map your workflow, identify the highest-value things to automate, and build it. You review it. It runs.

Worth 20 minutes to walk through what that would look like for [BUSINESS NAME]?

**Subject:** Last note on automation for [BUSINESS NAME]

Hi [FIRST NAME],

## 8B — Phone Call Script (Workflow Automation)

**OPENER:**
"Hey [FIRST NAME], how've you been? [YOUR NAME] from SystemGoat. We build automations for [TRADE] businesses — things that save time and make sure nothing falls through the cracks. Quick question: what's the most repetitive thing you or your team deals with every day in the business?"

[Let them answer. Whatever they say — that's your entry point.]

**DISCOVERY:**
"And how much time would you say that takes per week, rough estimate?"
"Is that something you've ever tried to systemize or automate, or has it just always been manual?"
"If you could recover [X hours] per week, what would you do with that time — more jobs, less late nights, something else?"

**PITCH:**
"The businesses we've worked with in [TRADE] — we typically find 3 to 5 things in the first week that are completely automatable with tools they're probably already paying for. Lead follow-up, appointment confirmation, review requests, invoice reminders. Things that take your time every day but don't require your judgment to get done.

We map it out, build it, and then it just runs. Most clients save 5–10 hours a week. The ROI math is usually pretty obvious."

**OBJECTIONS:**

**"We're not technical."**
"You don't have to be. We handle everything on the technical side. You just tell us what your workflow looks like and what's driving you crazy — we translate that into an automation. You review it, approve it, and we flip the switch."

**"We don't have the budget."**
"I'd push back gently on that. What does 5 hours a week of your time cost? If the answer is more than what we charge, you're actually losing money by not doing this. And we can start with the one automation that has the most obvious ROI and build from there."

**CLOSE:**
"What I'd love to do is run a free workflow audit for [BUSINESS NAME] — I'll map out what your team does day-to-day and identify the top 3 automation opportunities. Takes about 30 minutes on a call. Can we put something on the calendar this week?"

# APPENDIX A: UNIVERSAL OBJECTION RESPONSES

Keep these handy. They apply across all services.

**"Send me some information."**
"Happy to — and I want to make sure I send you something actually relevant rather than a generic overview. Can I ask you two quick questions first so I can tailor what I send?" [Then ask 2 discovery questions. Moves the conversation forward.]

**"We already have someone doing that."**
"Great — can I ask who's handling it and what results you're seeing? I ask because sometimes businesses have a solution in place that isn't quite performing the way they expected, and I want to know if that's the case before I take any more of your time."

**"I need to talk to my partner/wife/accountant."**
"Totally fair. Let me make that conversation easier — can I send you a one-pager with the specific ROI numbers so you have something concrete to share? What's the best email?" [Gets the email. Keeps the deal moving.]

**"Is this a long-term contract?"**
"No long-term contracts on our core services. We keep it month-to-month because we believe if it's working, you'll stay. If it's not working, you shouldn't be locked in."

**"We tried something like this before and it didn't work."**
"That's worth understanding — what happened? Was it the strategy, the execution, or the reporting?" [Listen. This is a discovery goldmine. Most bad experiences are from generic vendors who didn't customize the approach.]

# APPENDIX B: DISCOVERY QUESTION BANK

Use 3–4 of these per call. Never rush past the answers.

**Situation questions:**
- "How do most of your customers find you right now?"
- "What does your typical week look like — are you mostly on jobs, mostly managing, or a mix?"
- "How many people are on your team right now?"
- "What tools are you currently using to manage your customer list / schedule / invoicing?"

**Pain questions:**
- "What's the biggest administrative headache in the business right now?"
- "Have you ever lost a job and found out later you just didn't follow up fast enough?"
- "What keeps you up at night about the business?"
- "If you could fix one thing about how the business runs tomorrow, what would it be?"

**Implication questions (make the pain feel real):**
- "If that keeps going for another year, what does that cost you?"
- "How many jobs per month do you think you might be losing to that problem?"
- "What does your competitor who's doing better than you do differently?"

**Value questions (get them to say the number):**
- "If you could solve that problem completely, what would that be worth to you per year?"
- "What would 5 extra hours a week mean for you and the business?"
- "If your Google rating went from [current] to 4.5, what do you think that would do to your inbound calls?"
